# Proper_Game

A simple yet oddly charming 2D game that I made a couple of years ago. The concept is straightforward — an enemy with a sword charges toward you, and you defend yourself by shooting fire bullets. It’s a battle of fire vs. sword, and, let’s face it, fire usually wins.


Game Features:

=> Start Screen: Because every game deserves a grand beginning.

=> Win Screen: For those rare moments when you actually defeat the sword-wielding enemy.

=> Dead Screen: When things don’t go as planned… (which, let’s be honest, happens a lot).

=> Game Screen: The battlefield, where the real action unfolds.


This game was so creatively named “Proper_game” — a nod to how little thought I put into the title (but hey, it gets straight to the point, right?). Despite its simplicity, I’m proud of this project because, hey, I made it in Unity!

Enjoy the chaos, or don’t — it’s all part of the experience.
